This repository demonstrates the implementation of Simple Linear Regression, one of the most fundamental machine learning algorithms. It models the relationship between a single independent variable (X) and a dependent variable (Y) using a straight line.

📌 Key Points

Predicts outcomes based on one feature.

Assumes a linear relationship between variables.

Equation: Y = mX + b

⚙️ Features

Data preprocessing and visualization

Training the model using Scikit-learn

Evaluating performance with metrics like R² and MSE

📊 Example Use Case

Predicting house price based on its size.
